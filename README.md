# Numerical Methods
Numerical Methods in Python.

Implementations, example usage, comparison with library functions.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Whatever library is mentioned in the project's requirements.txt file.

## Installation

To run *.py* scripts the recommended approach is to use virtualenv:

    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python path/to/main.py

For *.ipynb* notebooks you do not need to install anything locally on your PC. You may run all of the examples on the official website of Jupyter Notebooks using a demo version:

https://jupyter.org/try

To run the notebooks locally, use the following command:

   $ jupyter notebook path/to/notebook.ipynb
