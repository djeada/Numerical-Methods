## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. 

## Key Concepts

- It is an extension of simple linear regression used to predict an outcome variable based on several independent variables.
- It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the single output variable.

## Mathematical Formulation

The multiple linear regression model is defined as:

$$
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βn*Xn + ε
$$

Where,
  Y is the dependent variable.
  β0 is the y-intercept.
  β1 to βn are the coefficients of the independent variables X1 to Xn.
  ε is the error term.

The goal of MLR is to find the values of the coefficients (β0, β1,..., βn) that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Collect and preprocess data: The data should be prepared in the form of a dataset of predictors/independent variables and a response/dependent variable.
2. Construct the regression model using a suitable method such as the Least Squares method.
3. Check the significance of the regression model, typically using statistical hypothesis testing methods.
4. Interpret the model coefficients, and use the model for prediction or inference.

## Example

Suppose we have a dataset with house prices as the dependent variable and the number of rooms and the age of the house as independent variables. We can use MLR to understand how the number of rooms and the age of the house affect the house price.

## Advantages

- It can handle multiple input variables.
- It provides a holistic view of the relationships between variables.

## Limitations

- Requires assumption of linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.
- Correlation does not imply causation, and MLR can't be used to establish causal relationships.
- May suffer from multicollinearity, overfitting, and other problems if not properly applied.
