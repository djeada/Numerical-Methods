## Picard's Method

Picard's method, also referred to as the method of successive approximations, is employed for solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It utilizes an iterative technique to identify the solution of an ODE. While being simple and straightforward, the method might converge slowly.

## Mathematical Formulation

Picard's method is based on expressing the ODE solution as an infinite series and then approximating this solution by truncating the series after a finite number of terms. Given a first-order ODE of the form $y' = f(x, y)$ with initial condition $y(x_0) = y_0$, the iterative formula for Picard's method can be written as:

$$y_{n+1}(x) = y_0 + \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t, y_n(t)) dt$$

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initiate with an initial approximation $y_0(x)$.
2. Compute $y_{n+1}(x) = y_0 + \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t, y_n(t)) dt$.
3. Iterate step 2 for a specified number of iterations $n$ or until the solution approximation becomes satisfactory.

## Example

Consider the ODE $y' = x + y$ with the initial condition $y(0) = 1$.

Starting with an initial approximation $y_0(x) = 1$:

1. Evaluate $y_1(x) = 1 + \int_0^x (t + y_0(t)) dt = 1 + \int_0^x (t + 1) dt = 1 + [\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t]_0^x = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x$.
2. Determine $y_2(x) = 1 + \int_0^x (t + y_1(t)) dt = 1 + \int_0^x (t + 1 + \frac{1}{2}t^2 + t) dt = 1 + [\frac{1}{6}t^3 + t^2 + t]_0^x = 1 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + x^2 + x$.
3. Continue this process until a satisfactory approximation of the solution is obtained or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

In this case, the successive approximations to the solution of the ODE $y' = x + y$ would be $y(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x$ and $y(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + x^2 + x$.

## Advantages

- Picard's method is easy to apply and provides a series solution to the ODE.

## Limitations

- Each step involves the evaluation of an integral, potentially leading to computational expensiveness.
- Convergence is not guaranteed. The method may fail if $f(x, y)$ or its integral is not well-behaved.
- The method might converge slowly, particularly for stiff or highly nonlinear ODEs.
