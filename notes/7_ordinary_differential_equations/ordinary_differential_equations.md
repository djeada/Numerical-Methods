The goal is to obtain an approximate solution to the ODE at a finite set of points.

The general first-order ODE:

$$ u'(t)=f(u(t),t) $$ 

$$ u(t_0)=u_0 $$

It may be expressed in words as follows:

1. The derivative of $u$ with respect to $t$ is a known function of $u$ and $t$. 
2. We know the that $u_0$ is the initial condition of $u$ at time $t_0$.
