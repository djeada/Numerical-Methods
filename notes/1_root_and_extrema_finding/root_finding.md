## Linear systems

A linear system can be represented by a linear function (straight line) that looks like this:

$$ f(x) = ax + b $$

A linear equation associated with a linear function is expressed as follows:

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

Our goal will be to obtain a solution $x$Â for this equation. For linear problems, the formula is $x = -b/a$. But the idea is that we may generalize useful insights from linear problems to nonlinear systems.

Nonlinear systems include at least one nonlinear element, that might one of the following:

- Powers: $x^2, x^3, \ldots $

- Roots, radicals and other non-integer polynomials: $ \sqrt{x}, x^{3/5}, x^{pi} \ldots $

- Trigonometric and other special functions: $\sin(x), \tan(x), \log(x), \ldots $
