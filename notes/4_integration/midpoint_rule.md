## Midpoint Rule

The region between the integral boundaries is divided into $n$ subintervals. 
At the midpoint of each subinterval, we evaluate the function $f(x)$. 
So, if our subinterval is defined by $x_l$ and $x_r$, our rectangle will have the following coordinates:

$A = (x_l, f(\frac{x_l + x_r}{2}))$

$B = (x_r, f(\frac{x_l + x_r}{2}))$

$C = (x_r, 0)$

$D = (x_l, 0)$

The areas of each of those rectangles are then calculated, and the integral approximation is just the sum of all those areas.
